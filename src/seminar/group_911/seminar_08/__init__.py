Turning seminar 7 game into object-oriented representation

1. Let's turn the board module functions into the Board class
    How can we protect class attributes from outside changes?

    protecting class attributes from outside change:
        C#, Java, Kotlin, C++ -> public, protected, private (keywords)
        public -> anyone can access and change
        private -> only class functions can access and change
        protected -> only class functions and derived classes can access and change
        (default)

        Python
        <var. name> -> public
        _<var. name> -> private (convention)
        __<var. name> -> private (convention!?, name mangling)
