"""
Write an application that manages a list of rectangles.
Each rectangle is represented using its two opposite corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
The application will have a menu-driven user interface and will provide the following features:

    1. Add a rectangle
        - adds the given rectangle to the list.
        - error if the given rectangle already exists, x1 <= x2 or y1 <= y2

    2. Delete a rectangle
        - deletes the rectangle with the given corners
        - error if non-existing rectangle is given

    3. Show all rectangles
        - shows all rectangles in descending order of their area

    4. Show rectangles that intersect a given one
        - select a rectangle from the list of existing rectangle
        - print those which intersect it by descending order of area

    5. exit
        - exit the program

    Observations:
        - Add 10 random rectangles at program startup
        - Write specifications for non-UI functions
        - Each function does one thing only, and communicates via parameters and return value
        - The program reports errors to the user. It must also report errors from non-UI functions!
        - Make sure you understand the rectangle's representation
        - Try to reuse functions across functionalities (Less code to write and test)
        - Don't use global variables!
